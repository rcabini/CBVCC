# CBVCC
Metrics and tools for the Cell Behavior Video Classification Challenge (CBVCC): a challenge designed to develop/adapt computer vision methods for classifying videos capturing cell behavior through Intravital Microscopy (IVM).
The primary goal of the CBVCC challenge is to create models that can accurately classify videos based on the movement patterns of cells. Specifically, the models should be able of:

* Identifying videos where cells exhibit sudden changes in their direction of movement.
* Distinguishing these from videos where cells show consistent, linear movement, stationary cells as well as from videos containing only background.

The CBVCC challenge aims to provide a platform for researchers to develop innovative methods for classifying IVM videos, potentially leading to new insights into biological processes. More details are available available [here](https://immunemap.org/index.php/challenges-menu/cbvcc).
